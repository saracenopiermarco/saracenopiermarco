# 👋 Hi, I'm Piermarco Saraceno

I am a computational scientist with experience in **molecular simulations, time-dependent modeling, and scientific software development**.  
I enjoy turning complex problems into efficient solutions and communicating them clearly.

## 💻 Key Skills

- **Computational Modeling & Simulations** – designing and optimizing models for dynamical systems.  
- **Software Development** – major contributor to open-source projects such as [pyQME] (https://github.com/Molecolab-Pisa/pyQME).  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization** – creating clear and compelling visualizations for complex datasets.  
- **Communication & Multimedia** – skilled in presenting results effectively, including slides, figures, and videos.

## 🕺 Not only work…

Besides my computational chemist carreer and especially besides my amateur musician career, I also enjoy **building fun and random projects** in my spare time, such as:

🤖 Telegram bots for everyday tasks

🧪 other small computational chemistry projects

🎲 other very **random** things
            - **for example:** a collaborative project with my friend and colleague **Ivan Giannì**, where we implemented the full rule engine of the board game *The Game* and generated a supervised training set to teach a PyTorch score‑based decision-making Machine Learning model.                  Repo: https://github.com/i-gianni/Tegame/tree/main
